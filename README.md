# Smart Rescue App

The Smart Rescue App is a tool designed to help locate and connect with nearby animal shelters during emergencies. With a simple tap on the Rescue button, the app fetches the user's GPS location and returns a list of nearby shelters, enabling faster response for animal rescues.

## Features
- Real-time GPS location detection
- Nearby animal shelters listing (sorted by distance)
- Quick contact options (call, WhatsApp, email)
- Google Maps directions

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React (with Leaflet maps)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB
- APIs: Google Maps (directions), WhatsApp/Email integrations

## Work in Progress
This project is currently under development. We're currently focussed on polishing core functions of the app. We're yet to style the app.
